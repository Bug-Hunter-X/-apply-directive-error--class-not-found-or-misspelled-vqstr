This error occurs when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive with a class that doesn't exist or is misspelled.  For example:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 @apply text-red-700  text-wrong-color">
  Some text
</div>
```

If `text-wrong-color` is not defined in your Tailwind configuration, it will result in no styling applied.  The error isn't always obvious as it simply won't style the element; there is no error message in the browser console.
