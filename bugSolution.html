To fix this, verify that `text-red-700` and any other classes used with `@apply` are correctly defined in your `tailwind.config.js` file. Ensure there are no typos. 

Here's the corrected HTML:

```html
<div class="bg-blue-500 @apply text-red-700">
  Some text
</div>
```

This revised code removes the undefined class, leading to the expected styling.
